## Terminology
- Database instance: isolated database in the cloud
- DB engine type: DB type you want to run (pgsql, mysql etc)
- DB instance class: CPU + memory capacity of DB instance
- Multi AZ: Fault tolerance / high availability
- Read replica: A node a part of the db instance that only reads queries (burdens load from master)
- Primary host: node within DB that handles the read / write traffic of the db
- Secondary host: the backup of primary incase of failover
- Aurora: cloud native engine that aws created for pgsql and mysql# RDS-Notes
